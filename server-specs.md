#Server Specifications

The server runs on a true powerhouse dedicated server with a high-speed Intel Quad-Core i7-2600 processor for a total of 8 "cores" @ 3.40 GHz, 32 GB DDR3 RAM, and equipped RAIDed SATA 7200rpm 6 Gb/s hard disk drives.
The whole Minecraft server runs many custom tweaks and settings to java and the linux system to seriously optimize performance. We think you will really see the difference compared to other servers.

The servers write to disk (with very short lag) every five minutes, and a backup is taken once per day. Backups are stored off-site. Our worlds should be quite safe. If we can help it, **no major work will ever be lost**, and we will never do a map-wipe without it being absolutely necessary. In that case, maps will be shared on the forum or via torrent. This will also be the case when/if the server retires.

The server is physically located in a very central datacenter in EU, with high-speed access to all major internet-uplinks. Latency should be quite low and in-game smoothness should be very good from all over Europe. It is on a gigabit link in a redundant 100 % switched network; no collision domains.

The servers themselves monitor server health on a regular basis and if it notices a dip in TPS, it will restart the server in an attempt to fix the problem if staff are not around.

24/7 Monitoring, datacenter staff 24/7, redundant power and connections make damNation a very stable server.
