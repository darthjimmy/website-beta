**Where are you from:**

Denmark

**When were you born?**

1984

**When did you join damNation**

August 2012


**What is your favourite thing about minecraft from a player perspective?**

Redstone minimalism, and small scale structures in general (yes the spaceship was very unusual for me) Exploration is the next best thing, and that is probably the reason I like damnation that much.


**Apart from minecraft what other games to you enjoy?**

I mostly play small random humblebundle games for short times, mostly puzzle or platformers. Other than that I play WoW but I never liked the end-game part of that


**What are your all-time legendary games?**

The Zelda and Mario series in general.


**What's your MC server staffing background and how did you end up on damNation?**

Well my best friend Rasc told of now closed german server called Dervonz. I settled down as a normal player there, and had fun exploring minecraft. This was also the place I meet ReZun. After the german server died (due to an admin griefing the entire server) I played a bit with my own server along with ReZun and Rasc. That turned out to be a bit to quiet and we left in different directions, with me and Rasc mostly going on a tekkit server. Sometime later I got in contact with ReZun which told me about this server, and after that I got stuck here


**What has been your favourite moment(s) in your minecraft staff career?**

Trick question! I do not do it to get good moments, but to give us all the possibility to get good moments.


**How do you sum up your staff style? What makes you mad and what makes you happy?**

Hmm...mad....not so sure about that....I get sad though :P I'm sad every time I have to use my negative staff powers like banning, muting. The happy moments is when I get time to make something technically better, like making new small micro plugins.


**If you could implement one thing on the server requiring only a snap of your fingers..., no matter how crazy, what would it be?**

"magically" make everyone that join non-griefing, nice and well behaved :P More realistic wish is Interserver linking with modded servers (the MC-api might eventually give this), where I could walk into a portal from a totally different server running mc 1.7 and walk into damnation running mc 1.8 and then walk into the ftb server. all without restarting my client.


**And finally...**

I would like to thank OM for his generous donation that makes this server work. This includes the time, the money, the tolerance and knowledge. I would also like to put out a special thanks to Rasc, that is always there for me =)
