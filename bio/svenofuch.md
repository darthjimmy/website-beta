**What is your favourite thing about minecraft from a player perspective?**

The casual nature of doing what you want, when you want it. The game is what YOU make it.


**Apart from minecraft what other games to you enjoy?**

Fallout series, Assassin's Creed series, chess


**What are your all-time legendary games?**

Baldur's Gate blew my mind when it came out.


**What's your MC server staffing background and how did you end up on damNation?**

This is the first server I ever dedicated any serious time to, and my first gig as admin. I think I just googled my way here, I don't quite remember.


**What has been your favourite moment(s) in your minecraft staff career?**

My first application approved, and my first player helped are very fresh in my memory! :-)


**How do you sum up your staff style? What makes you mad and what makes you happy?**

I enjoy figuring out the settings and flags and commands available to us. I enjoy guiding new players through the first steps of becoming self sufficient members of the community. I DON'T enjoy immature loud mouths or entitled lazy brats...but I suppose I have more patience than most for such annoyances. Comes from 20 years of professional customer service in different fields, haha!


**If you could implement one thing on the server requiring only a snap of your fingers..., no matter how crazy, what would it be?**

Ooof, still discovering everything Minecraft has to offer...But I suppose more flexibility with building materials. Like stairs of any material, chests of any material etc. 


**And finally...**
