1990

May 2013


**What is your favourite thing about minecraft from a player perspective?**

Even though I'm not the best builder, I enjoy the creative aspect of the game. I love just starting a building project and see where it goes. When I finish a project, I like to go back into survival and just play the game from the start again. It just keeps grabbing my interest.


**Apart from minecraft what other games to you enjoy?**

Portal, Skyrim, Sid Meyer's Civ games, loads of others....


**What are your all-time legendary games?**

I don't usually put a lot of time into games. I usually like to play one game until I get bored, then move on. For some reason, I keep coming back to minecraft...


**What's your MC server staffing background and how did you end up on damNation?**

This is the first time I've staffed a server. It's actually really only the 2nd server I've played on. I came to damNation because I was browsing reddit one day, and came upon a certain post... Needless to say, I liked what I saw. I hopped on the server and immediately signed up. The rest, as they say, is history.


**What has been your favourite moment(s) in your minecraft staff career?**

The best thing about being staff is helping people out. It's pretty much as simple as that. I love answering questions, and interacting with the community.


**How do you sum up your staff style? What makes you mad and what makes you happy?**

Rule-breaking and lying make me angry. Awesome builds and being friendly in the community make me happy!


**If you could implement one thing on the server requiring only a snap of your fingers..., no matter how crazy, what would it be?**

A thriving city with a rich economy, where going to the market doesn't cause lag. Where we can have arenas and minigames and arcades within the city limits. Where we have a subway system that takes us to our destinations (and not with just minecarts, but where we can build working trains)....

Well, I can dream, can't I?
