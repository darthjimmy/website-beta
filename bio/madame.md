#Madame

**Where are you from:**

Australia


**When were you born:**

1992


**When did you join damNation:**

October 2013


**What is your favourite thing about minecraft from a player perspective?**

Dude, the creativity. You want to build a giant mansion? Great! You want to spend three months making a giant diamond replica of a certain part of male human anatomy? You can do that, just not on damnation or we will ban you and giggle about it later. ^_^


**Apart from minecraft what other games to you enjoy?**

All... All the games?


**What are your all-time legendary games?**

Probably Assassin's Creed (The earlier ones anyway) and Portal? Really they're the only two games besides Minecraft I've played over and over again.


**What's your MC server staffing background and how did you end up on damNation?**

I started playing here on the 14th of October 2013 and immediately died a lot. Over the next three months, between various deaths, I became super duper active in the community and eventually begged the then owner of RCA for permission to make the RCA server pretty. He agreed, and perhaps unwisely made me an RCA admin. Several totally-not-my-fault crashes later RCA was looking beautiful and I was starting to look for more things to do - at which point they made me admin of main, only three months after I started playing here. Whether that was a mistake on the part of the higher-ups is debatable, but I've gotten used to working really hard on here so they can't change their minds now >:D


**What has been your favourite moment(s) in your minecraft staff career?**

I could write something long and inspirational about how much I love seeing people work together on huge builds (I do) and participating in the community (Love it), but I'll have to say my favourite moment was watching one player manually log in and out several dozen times in an attempt to DDOS us.

I'm easily amused.


**How do you sum up your staff style? What makes you mad and what makes you happy?**

By now you should have some idea of my sense of humour; my staffing style consists of a lot of bad jokes, occasional snarkiness and a lot of teasing. Very few things make me mad (I'm usually just amused, tbh) but harassment and bullying of other players can sometimes mean an insta-ban and an Irritated Madame for several hours. Making me happy is easier than that, though - just pay me a couple transparent compliments and you're set.

I'm fickle ^_^


**If you could implement one thing on the server requiring only a snap of your fingers..., no matter how crazy, what would it be?**

I would make it possible for people to enjoy server-side mods (Carpenter's blocks, Thaumcraft, etc etc) without having to actually download them themselves. Ahh, if only...


**And finally...**

Uh, bye? :D
