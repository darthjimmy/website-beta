**Where are you from:**

United States


**When were you born:**

1994


**When did you join damNation:**

July 2013


**What is your favourite thing about minecraft from a player perspective?**

Adventuring and exploration are my favorite aspects of the game and I love mod packs that add structures and features worth venturing into. On the creative side, I also love to use command blocks to create things like minigames or magic spells within the vanilla game.


**Apart from minecraft what other games to you enjoy?**

Mostly short Indie games, RPGs, dungeon crawlers, and well rounded plot-driven games.


**What are your all-time legendary games?**

RuneScape was the game that got me into gaming in May 2005. I quit in 2011 after my password and items were stolen, quickly moving on to this new game I found called Minceraft or something. Since then I bought a better computer and I've gotten around to playing some of the games I've always wanted to. Minecraft and RuneScape are in a league of their own, but my legendary games are Skyrim, Mass Effect 2, and Assassin's Creed 2.


**What's your MC server staffing background and how did you end up on damNation?**

Prior to playing on damNation, I had only played on a small local server with friends. After our final map shut down, I looked around for a new place to call home, and found damNation. After joining in July 2013, I've played religiously here ever since. I offer to help anywhere I can, which was greeted with eventual admin responsibilities on the PvP and PvE servers and co-ownership of the minigames server.


**What has been your favourite moment(s) in your minecraft staff career?**

My favorite moments are when players tell us how much they enjoy something that we've put a lot of time into. It's a great feeling to have someone have fun with something you've created.


**How do you sum up your staff style? What makes you mad and what makes you happy?**

I love socializing and helping people. If you have a problem or issue, I'll try my damndest (pun very much intended) to fix it, or refer you to someone who can. Even before I was an admin, I liked to go out of my way to make people feel welcome on the server as was done for me when I joined. Consequently, I always appreciate when I see other players doing the same; it's what makes damNation unique and worth spending hours every day here. I want to make the player base feel like we're players just like them, rather than some distant, cold, authoritative power.

Lying, cheating, and lying about cheating will cause the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog to flash his pointy teeth, but with cooperation and a simple apology, you'll find the Holy Hand Grenade isn't quite needed.


**If you could implement one thing on the server requiring only a snap of your fingers..., no matter how crazy, what would it be?**

Real Talk: More community interaction. I'd like to think we're all friends on the server, but like with most social gatherings, cliques are formed, for better or for worse. I am not innocent of this, but I have always tried to include people wherever possible. I know first hand how it can be daunting to approach new people, especially in the context of a group that has months, if not years of history together. But it isn't impossible :) damNation is always receptive to new players, so though it may be hard to overcome that first hurdle, the eventual payoff in long-lasting friendship is definitely worth it.


**And finally...**

Thank you to all of the staff and players, past and present, who have made this server the greatest online community I've been a part of. Through playing here, I've found a home. Somewhere not only to unwind with mining and building after a long day, but a community where I've made some of the best friends I've ever met. You've helped me foster my dream of running a small YouTube channel to entertain a small group of friends. You've given me creative outlets I never would have had. You've given me perspectives into the lives and cultures of people all around the world I would never have met otherwise. You're all wonderful people and I don't regret a second of it.
