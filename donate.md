# Donations

*Note: With many server changes since the last donations info page was drawn up, here is your one-stop reference for how donations are run on damNation!*

It costs a fair amount (both money and time) to run this server. It's high-end dedicated hardware in a EU central datacenter. OriginalMadman foots the bill each month, but he does an awesome job keeping the server ticking over, and greatly appreciates your financial support. If would like to make a donation (in keeping with the terms of the MC EULA) to keep our dedicated server up and running, please throw some money via the PayPal links on the page linked below! Please put your player name in the notes however, so we know who to thank.

**We will NEVER cripple non-donating members.**

Donations are strictly voluntary, and is something you do because you love the server and want to contribute a bit. I try to offer rewards back that are nice, but not game-breaking or unbalancing towards non-donors (more suggestions welcome).

The suggested donation amount is 10 euro. Any amount is fine (certainly more), but 10 euro is the minimum to give you donor privileges. You may donate more of course and I will be thankful and reward accordingly.

***Note:** Donor privileges is a boon, they are NOT a "right". It is not a service you are buying, it is a thanks you are granted. Remember this difference. Rules must still be followed, and we reserve the right to remove privileges and ban users regardless of donations.*

All donor money will go 100% to server maintenance/upgrade costs and buying ads/premiums stuff for the server. Current goals are to reclaim some monthly costs, get 16 GB more RAM (already done! we're on 32G) and buying premium listing on some of the server lists (suggestions welcome). Update: newest goals are a stronger server with a newer higher end i7 and fresh SSD drives.

Click the paypal link to donate in Euro (USD and SEK currencies also accepted). Don't forget to write your username (in the "purpose" field) so I know who to credit. When your transaction is complete, please forward the email receipt to **bunnies1230@gmail.com** and let an admin know in-game.

Rules must still be followed, and we reserve the right to remove privileges and ban users regardless of donations, but we'll certainly be a bit more inclined towards our donors...*
