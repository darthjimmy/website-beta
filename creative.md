#Creative

damNation hosts a dedicated creative server with a multitude of worlds to serve any creative purpose.

###A few notes about the Creative Server

* The server is reachable at any time from its portal at **/server hub** or directly through **/server creative**
* All of your /homes from those worlds have been migrated to the creative server, so you can access your builds there.
* The worlds that have been moved over are *every* world with the default gamemode being "Creative"
* Not all worlds are accessible, as some are private player worlds. Many are accessible through a button hub near spawn
* It has its own **dynmap**, which is still being rendered. You can find it [here](http://damnation.eu/creativemap/)
* Arda has made its return to the server, taking its rightful place as the creative server's spawn world
* You can continue working on your worlds/plots as normal!
* The creative worlds of our network having their own server means that (on an individual basis) more people can be trusted with World Edit and even Voxel functions.
* World Edit is typically restricted to Hydra+, but with this new change, **we will be accepting applications** from Siren+ who wish to use the plugin. You can apply by filling out the application below and sending it in a PM to **bunnies1230**.
* Voxel permissions will only be considered on personal worlds. If granted, access will be solely for you and solely in that world. 
* Please note that very few people have access to Voxel due to its complex nature, so we still must to verify that you are familiar with the plugin and can use it responsibly. We are happy to teach the basics, just with some notice as to your availability.
