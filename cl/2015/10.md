* Homeland's Nexus received a renovation and reorganization!

**2015-10-19:**

* The loot table for TreasureHunts has been redone by Svenofuch! He's added new items and tweaked the values so that you'll not only get more crowns when you get chests, but chests will last longer and the loot inside will actually be worthwhile, even in common chests!
* Disabled RecipeLookup due to error spam.
* Upgraded BetterShops to 2.1.2
