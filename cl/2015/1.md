# January 2015

**2015-01-01:**

* Removed spruce farm at /warp sandfarm. Please use /warp treefarm instead.

**2015-01-02:**

* Upgraded AsyncWorldedit. Should improve the user experience in the Creative worlds!
* Added corpses, you'll leave a corpse where you die now. It will despawn eventually (probably an hour or restart)
* Added ability for Craftsman+ (donor ranks) to use color codes in Anvils. E.g. you can color your enchanted stuff, nametags etc. Use **/color list** to get the color codes.
* You may find "evil presences" in more survival worlds now.
 
**2015-01-03**

* Removed over a dozen warps in Homeland, largely to player builds. You can still visit ALL of these arwas by pressing warp buttons at /warp builds.

**2015-01-13**

* Moved Mob Arena to its original spot in Homeland. Use **/warp homeland mobarena** to get there. It's the same arena with the same configs. The Arcade world is now only for show.
* Rearranged signs at **/warp saints** to clear up more room and be more organized.
