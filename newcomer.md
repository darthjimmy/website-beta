# Welcome to damNation, novice Goblin!

This guide is a short step-by-step introduction how to get started on damNation and how to access our features and benefits to get the most out of your stay and experience here.

Once you made a successful application, an admin will promotion to Goblin. Goblin (light green color) is a "probational" rank when you are new. You can play normally, but with just a few small limitations - mainly meant to avoid issues with grief. After playing on the server for more than a week, you will likely have mined, built a home, ran around aimlessly, killed some enemies, and leveled up some stats, and may be eligible for a promotion to Siren which is our normal "full member" status. Higher ranks are attainable through simply playing on the server! Each rank comes with some added perks, which you can [read more about here]({{site.baseurl}}/ranks)! 

Enough of that, you'll learn it all later. As a new-born Goblin you'll probably want to do the following right away:

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##How To Start Out
</div>

1.  Get the free starter-kit in the information house near spawn in [Homeland]({{site.baseurl}}/homeland). Do /spawn to get there fast. It has some basics and some food so you won't starve.
2.  Vote for the server! This will get you some nice and easy cash to get started. You can vote daily on each site, earning you 200c per day. Check your money with /money. Read more
3.  Get an overview of the city and the different worlds on our server. Use [our excellent dynmap](https://damnation.eu/dynmap/) to see where you are and where you can go. Homeland is the main starting world, home to our Spawn City. Find out more about [The Multiverse of damNation.eu]({{site.baseurl}}/survival-worlds). If you want to go to wilderness, homeland is currently very full - so choose another newer or custom world.
4.  Understand [how to get around in the city]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-around) (besides walking, though we highly recommend taking a stroll). List all Homeland warps with **/warps**, then go to for instance /warp alleytown (which is an area more likely to have free plots).
5.  Look around the city for a **FREE** plot. While looking at the dynmap, plots with green borders are open and free for purchase. Available plots have signs on them that says "For Sale". New players may only claim **ONE** plot in Spawn City.
  * Buy the plot by right clicking on the sign and typing **/selfservice buy**
  * Starting plots are usually 20x20 blocks and you may build 20 high and dig as deep as you want (bedrock). Want higher? Buy some extra height with crowns.
  * Your plot is fully protected - no one else can build, destroy or take stuff from chests on it (they can open wood doors and use buttons though). However, you can easily [add players to your plot]({{site.baseurl}}/worldguard-guide) or even [share chests with them]({{site.baseurl}}/lwc-guide)!
7.  Set your home by typing **/sethome**. Now you can get back here by doing **/home** at any point in time. Goblins only have 1 home per world, but that will increase as you rank up! Extra homes must be set with a name **/sethome home2** or whatever name you like. List your homes with **/homes**. It is most comfortable to set different names in different worlds - and you can go between.
8.  Build your first home, set up your underground base, hit the wilderness, build in creative, play a minigame, or go on an adventure - it is up to you! Just remember you have up to **TWO WEEKS** to do something with your claimed city plot - **an incomplete build might return to the state due to inactivity**. We recommend most players build their first home in Spawn City, but you are free to build out in the wilderness immediately if you wish!
9.  Read up on the [many excellent plugins]({{site.baseurl}}/main-plugins) we have on the server. All carefully selected to help the game become less of a chore and more of a challenging, varied, fun and balanced building and adventure game. Use /help or just TAB-complete in chat if you need to find a command, or check out our: [Commands & Plugins Reference Guide](https://damnation.eu/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=591). Also have a look at our [Custom Recipes](https://damnation.eu/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=5780).

##Need Help?
</div>

We pride ourselves as being a friendly and welcoming community. If you need help with something, asking in global chat for help will likely lead to an admin or other community member answering your question or helping you out in another way. We love helping out new members take in the enormity that is our list of server features. Don't worry about asking a lot of questions in the beginning - we were all there, once!

However, don't beg for or pester admins unless it is actually called for. If an admin is active, they will either answer you or tell you to be patient if they are currently occupied. No freebies or gifts are granted. If you still need help and no admin is around use /modreq <message>. That files a request to the admins. Be detailed and use at the location of where the problem is as the admin will teleport to the exact location where you type the /modreq.</message>

##Need Materials?
</div>

*   Dig on your own plot to your hearts content.
*   Use the public treefarms at /warp treefarm (all kinds of wood) or at /warp south (for pine). Remember to replant.
*   The market has a lot of materials for sale (including unobtainable items in the state store) /warp market, or if you're not in Homeland use /warp homeland market. shift+clicking the chest to get more info and if you want to buy then type the amount in chat after shift+clicking.
*   You can get as much sand as you need at the Sand farm at /warp sandfarm.
*   You can start some easy mining in the public mine at /warp publicmine. But you can certainly also set up your own mining operation in any of the many worlds' wildernesses.
*   Trade with other players.

___

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Need Money?
</div>

*   [Vote!]({{site.baseurl}}/voting) It is by far the fastest and easiest way to earn cash. You can earn 200c by voting on each site every 24 hours.
*   Buy and sell stuff at the market
*   Play and win more than you lose at Mob Arena
*   Raid dungeons (hard, see below)
*   Help someone with a job for cash (or stuff)
*   Win or place well in a competition
*   Come with a particularly helpful suggestion or report a cheater
*   Complete challenge maps like Downward, t3c Parkour, or The Dropper on [Minigames]({{site.baseurl}}/mg-features)

## Want to explore the server and look for treasure?
</div>

Excellent, because damNation is a server of many hidden things and secrets! You will find the very first Treasure Chest in the spawn info house (starter kit), but there are more nearby!

In fact, many similar chests containing treasure and/or money are hidden around the server and especially around central Spawn city (not in player houses), there are many hidden areas and treasure rewards for finding them. Most warp locations have a hidden chest as well. Do **/tchest count** to see your progress in finding secret chests (counted per world, but Homeland has by far the most and is the best place to start).

Some friendly hints: Scout the terrain around Spawn, look for Temple of The Gods starting with the maze opposite the Tree Farm. Why not visit the library or pay your respects at the graveyard...

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
## Survival Multiverse
</div>

Main hosts a number of [survival worlds]({{site.baseurl}}/survival-worlds) like [the Nether]({{site.baseurl}}/the-nether), [the End]({{site.baseurl}}/the-end), [Kaleida (rainforest)]({{site.baseurl}}/kaleida), [Hoth (frozen)]({{site.baseurl}}/hoth), [Tremoria (amplified)]({{site.baseurl}}/tremoria), or [Glorantha (vanilla-custom)]({{site.baseurl}}/glorantha)? Head to **/warp nexus** to check out the multitude of worlds we have to offer. 

___

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
## Bungee Servers
</div>

**Main** (/server main) is the server you will likely spend the most time on. It hosts the bulk of what damNation has to offer, with so many features that even veterans haven't explored them all!

**Creative** (/server creative) features a [variety of worlds]({{site.baseurl}}/creative-worlds) to fit any creative need, be it a small plot or a large collaborative world!

**Minigames** (/server minigames) is an ever-expanding server that features mainstay attractions such as **Survival Games** and **The Dropper**, as well as heavier combat in **Capture The Flag**. The list of features is always changing, so [read more here about our current game roster]({{site.baseurl}}/mg-features)!

**Abaddon** (/server creative) is a hardcore survival gamemode that involves sprinting and tunneling through a ruined world filled with deadly monsters and priceless treasure. This is a custom gamemode made for damNation inspired by a previous feature called Gehenna. [Read more about Abaddon here]({{site.baseurl}}/ab-gameplay).

**Hub** (/server hub) is the server you first logged into! It's a simple starting area with portals to each of our active servers for easy access.

___

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
## Want to go out in the wilderness?
</div>

It is anywhere outside the city limit (seen on the dynmap blue area, or roughly where the monorail goes). But Homeland is very full already so there is also plenty of wilderness in the other Survival worlds, which you can access by portals at /warp nexus You may mine, dig and build anywhere in the wilderness in any world as long as the rules are followed and distance to other players are respected.

___

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
## Want to build something in Creative?
</div>

We have several Creative worlds available. As a tourist, you start out with access to [Plotworld]({{site.baseurl}}/plotworld). Visit there with **/server creative** and choose the button warp for Plotworld. 

Once there, read the signs, spend your first 200c (which you can get from one day of voting) and get your first plot by typing **/plotme auto** and you will get a private and protected 100x100 creative plot! Teleport to your first plot with **/plotme home**. Once you rank up to [Siren]({{site.baseurl}}/ranks), you can really get building by applying for WorldEdit powers in your plot.

___

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
## Want a dungeon challenge?
</div>

There are a couple of gnarly multilevel dungeons available on **Main**. You earn items and cash doing them. But beware, it get much harder as you go. We highly suggest enchanted iron gear, enchanted weapons, and splash potions. **You are also forbidden to tp/warp while inside.** Take note of the mossy cobblestone - trying to mine walls adjacent to it will open secret passages to allow you to continue your adventure! Fight your way to the final double chest on the final level for a nice prize. Make sure to press the reset button there to return to surface and the dungeon is reset for the next challenger. You can find dungeons at:

*   Near /warp sandfarm
*   Near /warp north
*   In [Foundland]({{site.baseurl}}/foundland), quite close to spawn (and another "lost" dungeon somewhere)
*   In [Panau]({{site.baseurl}}/panau), head forward up and into the mountains, there are some signs helping you find the way.
*   In [Remini]({{site.baseurl}}/remini), there are several custom dungeons waiting that reset for each player every two weeks.

___

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
## Want private and protected land?
</div>

Once you have played for a while, gathered some cash - you probably will want to protect a larger area in the wilderness and/or buy more city plots. **Read more:** [Land Ownership]({{site.baseurl}}/land-ownership)

___

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
## Are you an InfoAddict?
</div>

*   We have [very extensive stats on all players](http://damnation.eu/stats/) including high score lists! 
*   We kept our [very old stats](http://damnation.eu/oldstats/) as well
*   For mcMMO stats, skills, and high scores, try **/mcstats**, **/mcrank**, **/mctop**, and **/inspect (player)** while in-game

## Want to Support the Server?
</div>

Contribute to the significant costs and development of the server by considering making a small donation and receive some nice thank you perks!

The server is run completely on idealistic terms, and OriginalMadman pays for the brunt of it out of his own personal pocket (didn't even have donations for the first 6 months of operation). All donated money will go to server running costs (we do have [dedicated monster hardware in a datacenter]({{site.baseurl}}/server-specs)) and/or improvements/advertising.

See the [Donations page]({{site.baseurl}}/donate) for details about donation rates and perks.
