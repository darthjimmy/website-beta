# Membership Age

In the past, we have required members to be at least 18 years of age. In recent months, however, we have practiced an unwritten shift in how we enforce this rule with nothing but positive effects. As a result, our current written age policy has shifted. 

As in the past, an applicant will be accepted simple if they are verified as being 18+ in their application. *However*, if an applicant under 18 and *truthful about their age* in a well-written application, we may ask to chat with them in-game for a bit. Pending the staff member's decision, that applicant **will typically be accepted**. There will be no hard and fast requirements - each application will be dealt with as individuals, so the staff still retains the right to reject an application based on past bans, conduct in-game, or very young age.

This shift has come in part because though using 18+ is a decent measure of maturity, it is not a constant, so who are we to say a given 17 year old is not as mature as a given 19 year old? On the flip side, this new policy allows admins to be the gatekeepers of what makes someone "mature". The fact is, we don't have a textbook definition, but we have a pretty good idea whether or not someone will be trouble.

As a result, we are making the shift to refer to the server as **Mature** rather than **18+**, as it more accurately describes the "requirements" for joining the community.

Minecraft appeals to all ages, but communities online have to define their culture. Our culture is set to be enjoyable particularly those who have been around the world for quite some time, and think they know a thing or two about how the world works. The culture is set so that after a hard-day's work, study, or looking after kids players can drop in to the server and relax. **If you prefer to behave online as you do with your friends at School, then this is NOT the community for you.** We do not tolerate behaviour on our MineCraft server that many of us see in our own children when they misbehave. However, equally, we recognise that it is important that children ARE able to behave as children and not be forced to grow up beyond their years. So this is another reason why we have a minimum age. We are not here to run a social education club. Whilst a certain amount of rules and policies are set, if one player **takes up too much of our time** (and this is true of any age) through constant reminders of how they should be behaving, **their time in our community will be curtailed**.

####We hope you understand the purpose of our age policy. It has created a lasting and friendly community for years and we hope to continue that environment. Thank you for reading!
