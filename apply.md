## Step 1: Read and Accept Server Rules 
Read the [Rules and Policies](../rules.md "Rules and Policies"). The rules are very important to us. We are looking for players who want to be part of a grown-up minecraft community. Although age is no guarantee of maturity, players of 18+ years have already had (at least) some (if not lots of) life experience, and will understand that a community needs some sort of structure in order to maintain its existence. Our community has grown and developed, since 2011. Sections of our minecraft community have been playing minecraft together for almost three years, so we've been around. Our rules are important to us to help define, protect, shape and guide our community. Don't take them lightly.

## Step 2: Register on the forum
Your forum username **must be exactly identical** to your Minecraft name! Do **NOT** use the same password though. [Register on the damNation forum here](http://damnation.eu/phpbb/ucp.php?mode=register "Register"). Activate your account via the verification email. Be sure to check your spam folder.

## Step 3: Complete the details of your application
With the topic subject **only your username** and **nothing else**, make a "new topic" in [New Registrations forum](https://damnation.eu/phpbb/posting.php?mode=post&f=21 "New Registrations").

Answer (copy and paste, please) the 9 questions below in your application on the forum. Our forum is where you will find out if you will be accepted, or in time perhaps promoted, or heaven forbid, warned, or (it does happen to some people) banned.

a. Which year were you born?:

b. Where are you from? At least country (state/city is optional):

c. How long/much have you played Minecraft?

d. How did you find your way to damNation.eu?

e. **Conditional:** Do you have any previous bans from **any** server? If yes, why? And do explain why it won't become a problem for us here.

f. *Optional:* If you were referred by one of our members, please write their name here (Note: This does not include players you just met on the server who helped you):

g. *Optional:* Upload or link a couple of pictures of your builds:

h. *Optional:* Anything else you would like to add?:

i. **Answer "Yes, I accept" or "No":** I hereby understand that this is a cheatless server, and that this server uses many advanced methods of cheat detection and heavy monitoring. I understand that I am as good as guaranteed to receive a Global ban tarnishing my account, with no mitigating circumstances if I use any kind of cheat client or exploit on the server. I also understand that I must report all such activity to staff immediately or be at risk of being considered an accomplice. I have been warned and I take full responsibility for this accounts actions on the server:
